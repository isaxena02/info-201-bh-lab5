# load the data from the csv file located inside this repository and
# put it in a variable called `any_drinking'

# find the number of rows and columns in this dataset


## Create a data frame that has the `state` and `location` columns, and all columns with data from 2012


## Using the 2012 data, create a column that has the difference in male and female drinking patterns


## Create a *dataframe* of the locations, states, and differences for all locations where females drink more than males
## (no extra columns).
## Are there any locations where females drink more than males?
## Comment your result (as a comment)


## What is the location in which male and female drinking rates are most similar
## (*absolute* difference is smallest)?
## Your answer should be a *dataframe* of the location, state, and value of interest
## (no extra columns)


## As you've (hopefully) noticed, the `location` column includes national, state, and county level
## estimates.  However, many audiences may only be interested in the *state* level data.
## Given that, you should do the following:
## * Create a new data frame that is only the state level observations in 2012
## * For the sake of this analysis, you should treat Washington D.C. as a *state*
##
## Hint: check the 'state' and 'location' variables and think how to extract only
## state-level data


## Which state had the **highest** drinking rate for both sexes combined? 
## Your answer should be a *dataframe* of the state and value of interest (no extra columns)
##
## For your check: this is Vermont



## Which state had the **lowest** drinking rate for both sexes combined?
## Your answer should be a *dataframe* of the state and value of interest (no extra columns)



## What was the difference in (any-drinking) prevalence between the state with the highest level of
## consumption, and the state with the lowest level of consumption?
## Your answer should be a single value.
